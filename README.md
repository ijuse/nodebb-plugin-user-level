-----------------------------

The plugin allows creating and editing a list of levels for the user

The plugin displays user levels in posts and user profile pages

## Create and edit user-level lists

To create this list, admin can access the path `/admin/plugins/user-level`

Each level user needs a level name and a minimum value of reputation points to reach this level

The order of user levels can be messy (but should be in order that admins can easily manage)
